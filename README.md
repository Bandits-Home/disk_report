# disk_report
Run a report for disk usage from Nagios perf data

We have different customer prefixed with certain terms.  We use this script to run a report for current disk usage and it emails two csv files to the email address specified.

One file for Windows and one for Linux.

Our data may be different then yours, so use this as a good starting point if you need something similar!
